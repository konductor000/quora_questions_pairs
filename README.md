## Quora question pairs

In this project I fine-tuned BERT model on quora question pairs dataset, to solve sentence simmilarity task. I also implemented searching engine, in order, to quickly find top k most simmilar questions from the entire dataset to a given one, using sentence embeddings simmilarity. To find top k questions from dataset, it needs < 1 second.
